Curate Twitter content like never before.

== Description ==

A new powerful way to show Twitter content on your WordPress sites.  
We want our visitors to stay on the website - we don't want to redirect them elsewhere.

Curator Studio achieves this by being extremely flexible in pulling various types of Twitter sources.  
**Free version** can show your mentions and tweets from any user.  

**Pro version** can combine tweets from multiple users, hashtags, searches, lists, places etc.
